<p>This release candidate includes the new Lagom Scala API, fully documented and with feature parity with the Java API.</p>
<h2><a href="#scala-api-design-philosophy" name="scala-api-design-philosophy">Scala API design philosophy</a></h2>
<p>In Lagom, we want both the Java API and the Scala API to be first class citizens, not one API built on the other, or one API augmented so that it works with the other language. For this reason, we have created two completely separate APIs, these APIs are provided by completely separate libraries, and typically will not be on the classpath at the same time. The namespaces selected for these APIs follow the convention introduced by Akka streams, namely that the Java API has a package name of <code>javadsl</code>, while the Scala API has a package name of <code>scaladsl</code>.</p>
<p>In general, when creating the Scala API, we have typically started with the Java API, and then worked from there to make it more idiomatic for Scala use. Some of the major differences from the Java API include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compile time dependency injection. Lagom&rsquo;s Java API builds on Play&rsquo;s Guice support. Lagom&rsquo;s Scala API however uses a lightweight form of the cake pattern to wire dependencies together. This API is designed to work well with <a href="https://github.com/adamw/macwire">Macwire</a>, though Macwire is not required to use it.</li>
  <li>Stronger typed APIs where Scala allows, particularly in the persistent entity API.</li>
  <li>Use of type classes to provide serializers and path parameter extractors, rather than using reflection.</li>
  <li>Use of <a href="https://playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJson">play-json</a> for JSON serialization support.</li>
  <li>Use of macros to implement service clients, rather than dynamic proxies.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#other-features" name="other-features">Other features</a></h2>
<p>Other new features in this release include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JPA support, including JPA read side processor support.</li>
  <li>New test APIs for testing message broker integration.</li>
  <li>Activator is now deprecated, in favour of the new Giter8 support in sbt 0.13.13.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#sample-apps" name="sample-apps">Sample apps</a></h2>
<p>The Lagom team has been working on an auction system that demonstrates many of the features of Lagom. You can get the Java version <a href="https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-java">here</a> and the Scala version <a href="https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-scala">here</a>. Please be aware that these apps are still a work in progress.</p>
<h2><a href="#migration" name="migration">Migration</a></h2>
<p>There are no major API changes from 1.3.0-RC1, this release primarily just contains bug fixes.</p>]]></content>

  <li><code>LagomDevModeComponents</code> has been moved to the <code>com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.devmode</code> package.</li>
  <li>Streamed service calls are now required to declare their <code>Source</code> message types to materialize to <code>NotUsed</code>, where before they were required to materialize to an unbound wildcard.</li>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team are proud to announce the first milestone release of the Lagom Scala API, Lagom 1.3.0-M1! This release has been many months in the making, and we&rsquo;ve cut this milestone as a preview release in the hope that we can get some early feedback before we cut the final release.</p>
<h2><a href="#design-philosophy" name="design-philosophy">Design philosophy</a></h2>
<p>In Lagom, we want both the Java API and the Scala API to be first class citizens, not one API built on the other, or one API augmented so that it works with the other language. For this reason, we have created two completely separate APIs, these APIs are provided by completely separate libraries, and typically will not be on the classpath at the same time. The namespaces selected for these APIs follow the convention introduced by Akka streams, namely that the Java API has a package name of <code>javadsl</code>, while the Scala API has a package name of <code>scaladsl</code>.</p>
<p>In general, when creating the Scala API, we have typically started with the Java API, and then worked from there to make it more idiomatic for Scala use. Some of the major differences from the Java API include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compile time dependency injection. Lagom&rsquo;s Java API builds on Play&rsquo;s Guice support. Lagom&rsquo;s Scala API however uses a lightweight form of the cake pattern to wire dependencies together. This API is designed to work well with <a href="https://github.com/adamw/macwire">Macwire</a>, though Macwire is not required to use it.</li>
  <li>Stronger typed APIs where Scala allows, particularly in the persistent entity API.</li>
  <li>Use of type classes to provide serializers and path parameter extractors, rather than using reflection.</li>
  <li>Use of <a href="https://playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJson">play-json</a> for JSON serialization support.</li>
  <li>Use of macros to implement service clients, rather than dynamic proxies.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#status" name="status">Status</a></h2>
<p>The following APIs and features are complete:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Service API</li>
  <li>Message broker API with Kafka implementation</li>
  <li>Persistence API with both Cassandra and JDBC implmentations</li>
  <li>Dev mode</li>
  <li>Play integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following things are left to be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ConductR integration</li>
  <li>Some testkit APIs</li>
  <li>Much of the documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new Lagom Scala project, using sbt 0.13.13, run:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$ sbt new lagom/lagom-scala.g8
</code></pre>
<p>For a reasonably comprehensive demonstration of the Lagom Scala API, you can checkout the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-scala">online auction sample app</a>. Note that this is a work in progress, some things aren&rsquo;t complete yet. Of course, the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.3.x/scala/Home.html">documentation</a> is also a good place to go.</p>
<p>As this is a milestone release, the API is still considered experimental, and will likely change before the final release. Hence, we recommend not using it for any production services yet.</p>]]></content>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a month since releasing 1.2.0 and the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues">mailing list</a> and Lagom&rsquo;s <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/lagom">Gitter channel</a> have been <em>on fire</em>. Many are already developing their microservice-based solutions using Lagom, but Lagom is not (yet) free of bugs and the community has been great at helping spot some of these bugs both on documentation or the code itself. This release addresses <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/milestone/5?closed=1">some of these issues</a> improving documentation and performance, and fixing a regression introduced when releasing 1.2.0.

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team is proud to announce the release of Lagom 1.2! This release introduces support for message brokers, JDBC, and an overhaul of read sides.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along with the RCs, there have only been minor changes since RC2, but if you&rsquo;re upgrading from 1.1.0 or earlier, please be sure to follow the <a href="//www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/Migration12.html">migration guide</a>, as there are some changes you&rsquo;ll need to make to your project.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a recap of the major new features that were announced with the release candidates. You can see more details in the <a href="/changelog.html">change log</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.2.0">GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a href="#message-broker-support" name="message-broker-support">Message broker support</a></h2>
<p>The biggest feature of Lagom 1.2 is message broker support. This means Lagom now allows both direct streaming of messages between services, as well as streaming of messages through a broker.</p>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s message broker support does not require any one particular message broker implementation, however out of the box we have only implemented support for Kafka. Kafka is a popular very scalable message broker, and fits well in the Lagom architectural philosophy.</p>
<p>Lagom will automatically run Kafka for you when you run the <code>runAll</code> command, both in Maven and sbt, which makes getting started with a project that uses Kafka very simple. It also abstracts the publishing, partitioning, consuming and failure handling of messaging away from you, so you can focus primarily on your business concerns.</p>
<p>As with Lagom <code>ServiceCall</code>&rsquo;s, which provide a protocol agnostic way of directly communicating with other services that maps down onto HTTP, Lagom provides a new <code>Topic</code> abstraction, which represents a topic that one service publishes, and one or more services consume. Through the use of service descriptors, Lagom allows all the serialization and deserialization logic for these messages to be captured and shared between services.</p>
<p>As a first and primary use case, we have targetted publishing a persistent entity event stream for the source of topics. This allows the implementation of remote read sides, as well as provides a great basis for guaranteed at least once delivery of events between services.</p>
<p>To explore more of Lagom&rsquo;s message broker support, read the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/MessageBroker.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#jdbc-support" name="jdbc-support">JDBC support</a></h2>
<p>Feedback that we got from many potential users was that in order to introduce Lagom into their organisation, it would need to have support for using their existing relational database infrastructure. While a relational database is often not the best choice, particularly for storing event sourced entities, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad choice. We felt that having no JDBC support was an unnecessary blocker to organisations getting the benefits of a Lagom based architecture.</p>
<p>Lagom supports JDBC both for <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/PersistentEntityRDBMS.html">storing persistent entities</a>, as well as for implementing <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideRDBMS.html">read sides</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#read-side-overhaul" name="read-side-overhaul">Read side overhaul</a></h2>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s read side support has been overhauled. There are three major parts to this. First of all, read sides that talk to any data store can now be implemented - previously the read side processor API was specific to Cassandra. We still provide a Cassandra specific utility for building Cassandra read sides, as well as a new JDBC specific utility for building JDBC read sides, but these are just helpers for building read sides, you can build a read side in anything. Documentation for the new read side API can be found <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSide.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that read sides can now be sharded, by tagging persistent entity events with sharded tags. Lagom&rsquo;s read side processors now declare a list of tags that they process, rather than just one, and Lagom will automatically distribute the processing of these tags across the cluster. This is great for services with a high throughput of events, or when event processing can be very slow or expensive.</p>
<p>The final feature is that both the Cassandra and JDBC specific read side support utilities provide automatic offset tracking, meaning that your read side processors no longer need to explicitly load and persist offsets. This makes it much simpler to implement a read side processor. Documentation is available for both the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideCassandra.html">Cassandra read side support</a> and the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideRDBMS.html">JDBC read side support</a>.</p>
<p>The existing Cassandra read side support is still supported, but is deprecated.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the release candidates. There are more exciting things planned for Lagom 1.3, so please <a href="/get-involved.html">Get Involved</a> and help shape the future of Lagom.</p>]]></content>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that Lagom 1.2.0-RC2 has been released!</p>
<p>This release has a small reworking of the read side event tags so that events can be automatically sharded by Lagom. Previously, your <code>aggregateTag</code> function had to compute it&rsquo;s own sharded tags if you wanted to shard your read sides. Now, you can simply return a <a href="//www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/persistence/AggregateEventTag.html#sharded-java.lang.Class-int-">single meta tag</a> to say that the events should be sharded, and how many shards you want, and Lagom will handle the sharding for you. Read <a href="//www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSide.html#event-tags">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made some minor improvements around how Kafka message keys are <a href="//www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/MessageBrokerApi.html#Partitioning-topics">extracted from messages</a>, and provided topic testing support in the testkit.</p>
<p>On the documentation side, there&rsquo;s more documentation for using and testing Kafka, and most importantly, we&rsquo;ve written a <a href="//www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/Migration12.html">migration guide</a>, outlining any changes you may need to make in order to move from Lagom 1.1 to Lagom 1.2.</p>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we released Lagom 1.2.0-RC1, the first release candidate for the upcoming Lagom 1.2. This release has three exciting new features that we&rsquo;d like to tell you about.</p>
<h2><a href="#message-broker-support" name="message-broker-support">Message broker support</a></h2>
<p>The biggest feature of Lagom 1.2 is message broker support. This means Lagom now allows both direct streaming of messages between services, as well as streaming of messages through a broker.</p>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s message broker support does not require any one particular message broker implementation, however out of the box we have only implemented support for Kafka. Kafka is a popular very scalable message broker, and fits well in the Lagom architectural philosophy.</p>
<p>Lagom will automatically run Kafka for you when you run the <code>runAll</code> command, both in Maven and sbt, which makes getting started with a project that uses Kafka very simple. It also abstracts the publishing, partitioning, consuming and failure handling of messaging away from you, so you can focus primarily on your business concerns.</p>
<p>As with Lagom <code>ServiceCall</code>&rsquo;s, which provide a protocol agnostic way of directly communicating with other services that maps down onto HTTP, Lagom provides a new <code>Topic</code> abstraction, which represents a topic that one service publishes, and one or more services consume. Through the use of service descriptors, Lagom allows all the serialization and deserialization logic for these messages to be captured and shared between services.</p>
<p>As a first and primary use case, we have targetted publishing a persistent entity event stream for the source of topics. This allows the implementation of remote read sides, as well as provides a great basis for guaranteed at least once delivery of events between services.</p>
<p>To explore more of Lagom&rsquo;s message broker support, read the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/MessageBroker.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#jdbc-support" name="jdbc-support">JDBC support</a></h2>
<p>Feedback that we got from many potential users was that in order to introduce Lagom into their organisation, it would need to have support for using their existing relational database infrastructure. While a relational database is often not the best choice, particularly for storing event sourced entities, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad choice. We felt that having no JDBC support was an unnecessary blocker to organisations getting the benefits of a Lagom based architecture.</p>
<p>Lagom supports JDBC both for <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/PersistentEntityRDBMS.html">storing persistent entities</a>, as well as for implementing <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideRDBMS.html">read-sides</a>.</p>
<h2>Read-side overhaul</h2>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s read-side support has been overhauled. There are three major parts to this. First of all, read sides that talk to any data store can now be implemented - previously the read side processor API was specific to Cassandra. We still provide a Cassandra specific utility for building Cassandra read-sides, as well as a new JDBC specific utility for building JDBC read-sides, but these are just helpers for building read-sides, you can build a read-side in anything. Documentation for the new read-side API can be found <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSide.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that read-sides can now be sharded, by tagging persistent entity events with sharded tags. Lagom&rsquo;s read side processors now declare a list of tags that they process, rather than just one, and Lagom will automatically distribute the processing of these tags across the cluster. This is great for services with a high throughput of events, or when event processing can be very slow or expensive.</p>
<p>The final feature is that both the Cassandra and JDBC specific read side support utilities provide automatic offset tracking, meaning that your read side processors no longer need to explicitly load and persist offsets. This makes it much simpler to implement a read side processor. Documentation is available for both the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideCassandra.html">Cassandra read-side support</a> and the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.2.x/java/ReadSideRDBMS.html">JDBC read-side support</a>.</p>
<p>The existing Cassandra read-side support is still supported, but is deprecated.</p>
<h2>Onwards to 1.2.0</h2>
<p>We are hoping to release Lagom 1.2.0 in the coming month, so please check it out, jump on the <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/lagom">Gitter channel</a> and give us feedback!</p>]]></content>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team are proud to announce the release of Lagom 1.1! The primary new feature of Lagom 1.1 is maven support - this includes support for running the Lagom development environment in Maven.</p>
<p>Although running many services with hot reloads in Maven is not a traditional thing to do, as much as possible the Lagom Maven plugin makes idiomatic usage of Maven, meaning that it&rsquo;s still compatible with whatever Maven plugins or tooling that you use, including IDEs, code generators, testing tools and so on.</p>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s Maven integration also supports starting a full system environment as part of your integration tests, so you can do comprehensive testing of inter service communication.</p>
<p>You can get started today with a Lagom starter app by running:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.lightbend.lagom \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-lagom-java -DarchetypeVersion=1.1.0
</code></pre>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team are proud to announce the introduction of Maven support for Lagom! We&rsquo;ve published Lagom 1.1.0-RC1 with this support, and are keen to get feedback from users to see if it works.</p>
<h2><a href="#why-maven-" name="why-maven-">Why Maven?</a></h2>
<p>sbt is a very powerful build tool that made the implementation of Lagom&rsquo;s high productivity development environment very straight forward. Since it breaks a build up into very fine grained tasks that produce an output value, it&rsquo;s simple for the Lagom development environment to interrogate your build by executing those tasks to get the information it needs to setup Lagom&rsquo;s hot reloads. For this reason, we decided in the first release of Lagom to just support sbt.</p>
<p>Early feedback however has been that lack of Maven support is a blocker for many of our potential users. This is particularly true for large enterprise companies that have significant investments in their Maven infrastructure, including proxies, developer setup guides, and standardised pom files. For this reason, we&rsquo;ve decided to make the investment necessary to run Lagom in Maven.</p>
<h2>Let&rsquo;s take a look!</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made use of the Maven archetype plugin for users to create new projects using archetypes. So, this is what it looks like to create a new Lagom system using Maven:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.lightbend.lagom \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-lagom-java \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.1.0-RC1

<p>We now have our first Maven Lagom project!</p>
<h2><a href="#run-it" name="run-it">Run it</a></h2>
<p>One of the best features of Lagom, and the hardest feature to implement in a build tool, is Lagom&rsquo;s high productivity development environment. Let&rsquo;s check it out in Maven, we can run our project using the <code>lagom:runAll</code> goal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ cd my-first-system
$ mvn lagom:runAll
[INFO] Scanning for projects...

</code></pre>
<p>Some of the Maven output has been snipped here for brevity, but you can see that the following has happened:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cassandra has been started</li>
  <li>A service locator is running on port 8000</li>
  <li>A service gateway is running on port 9000</li>
  <li>Our services are running on various ports</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can access one of the services:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ curl http://localhost:9000/api/hello/Maven
Hello, Maven!
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#hot-reloads" name="hot-reloads">Hot reloads</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to be able to get started quickly to run services, but one of the biggest productivity killers that developers face in development is build/deploy loops. Lagom takes care of that for you, by watching all of your sources, and automatically recompiling and reloading them as soon as it sees a change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add a small string to the messsages returned by the hello service, in <code>hello-impl/src/main/java/com/example/hello/impl/HelloServiceImpl.java</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">  public ServiceCall&lt;NotUsed, String&gt; hello(String id) {
    return request -&gt; {
      // Look up the hello world entity for the given ID.
      PersistentEntityRef&lt;HelloCommand&gt; ref = persistentEntityRegistry.refFor(HelloEntity.class, id);
      // Ask the entity the Hello command.
      return ref.ask(new Hello(id, Optional.empty()))
          .thenApply(msg -&gt; msg + &quot; &lt;- that&#39;s the message&quot;);
    };
  }
</code></pre>
<p>As soon as I hit save, Maven outputs this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">[INFO] Copying 1 resource
[INFO] Changes detected - recompiling the module!
[INFO] Compiling 6 source files to /home/jroper/tmp/my-first-system/hello-impl/target/classes

--- (RELOAD) ---
</code></pre>
<p>And now if I hit the service again, you can see the updated message:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ curl http://localhost:9000/api/hello/Maven
Hello, Maven! &lt;- that&#39;s the message
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s much more to Lagom&rsquo;s Maven support, which you can find in the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.1.x/java/Home.html">Lagom documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Why not get started today, all you need is JDK8 and Maven installed, and you&rsquo;re set to start developing a reactive microservices system.</p>]]></content>
