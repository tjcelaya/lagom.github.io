<p>Lagom is a set of libraries and build tool plugins that provide a framework and development environment. While the libraries can be consumed from any build tool, Lagom&rsquo;s high productivity development environment requires specific build tool support, which will run your services and the associated Lagom infrastructure, hot reloading when code changes are detected, all with a single command.</p>
<p>Lagom supports two different build tools, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org">sbt</a>. These tools both provide dependency management which will download the Lagom libraries and plugins for you, so the only thing to install is one of these tools. Which you use is up to you.</p>
<p>sbt is a very powerful build tool that allows Lagom&rsquo;s features to be very easily supported and implemented - there are many aspects of the Lagom development environment that work a little smoother and faster in sbt than Maven due to sbt&rsquo;s power and flexibility. For this reason, sbt is the build tool of choice for the maintainers of Lagom.</p>
<p>However, many Java developers will find that their existing knowledge and familiarity of Maven will allow them to get started a lot faster with Lagom. Additionally, their organization may have existing infrastructure, plugins and best practices built around Maven that they want to take advantage of, making Maven a practical selection.</p>
<p>Either way, the Lagom team is committed to providing full support for both sbt and Maven, so either choice is a good choice.</p><h2 id="Installing-a-JDK"><a class="section-marker" href="#Installing-a-JDK">§</a><a href="#installing-a-jdk" name="installing-a-jdk">Installing a JDK</a></h2>
<p>Before installing a build tool, you need to ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Lagom requires at least JDK 8.</p>
<p>You can check whether you have JDK 8 by running <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> from the command line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$ java -version
java version &quot;1.8.0_74&quot;
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_74-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.74-b02, mixed mode)
$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_74
</code></pre>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have java and javac, you can get it from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle Java downloads page</a>.</p><h2 id="Installing-Maven"><a class="section-marker" href="#Installing-Maven">§</a><a href="#installing-maven" name="installing-maven">Installing Maven</a></h2>
<p>To install Maven, see the official <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">Maven installation page</a>.</p>
<p>Lagom requires at least Maven 3.2.1, earlier versions of Maven will not work with Lagom. We recommend that you use at least Maven 3.3. When checking your Maven version, make sure also that your IDE is configured to use a recent Maven version, many IDEs use an older version by default.</p><h2 id="Installing-sbt"><a class="section-marker" href="#Installing-sbt">§</a><a href="#installing-sbt" name="installing-sbt">Installing sbt</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org">sbt</a> is a build tool for Java and Scala.</p>
<p>Lagom requires at least sbt 0.13.5, but if you want to create new projects using Lagom&rsquo;s supplied templates, you&rsquo;ll need at least sbt 0.13.13, which contains the sbt new command.</p>
<p>sbt can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html">here</a>, while instructions for installing it can be found <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html">here</a></p>
<p>To check which version of sbt you are using, run <code>sbt sbt-version</code>, for example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ sbt sbt-version
[info] Set current project to example (in build file:/home/example/)
[info] 0.13.13
</code></pre><h2 id="Proxy-Setup"><a class="section-marker" href="#Proxy-Setup">§</a><a href="#proxy-setup" name="proxy-setup">Proxy Setup</a></h2>
<p>If you can only access the web through a proxy, set the <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable to your proxy&rsquo;s URL, for example, <code>HTTP_PROXY=http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</p>
