<p>When decoupling communication via a Broker you can test from both ends of the <code>Topic</code>. When your <code>Service</code> is publishing events into a <code>Topic</code> (as described in <a href="MessageBrokerApi.html#declaring-a-topic">Declaring a Topic</a>) your tests should verify the proper data is being pushed into the Topic. At same time, when your service is subscribed to an upstream <code>Topic</code> you may want to test how your <code>Service</code> behaves when there are incoming events.</p>
<p>A broker will not be started neither when writing publish nor consumption tests. Instead, Lagom provides in-memory implementations or the Broker API in order to make tests faster. Integration tests with a complete broker should be later implemented but that is out of scope of this documentation. The provided in-memory implementation of the Broker API runs locally and provides exactly-once delivery. If you want to test your code under scenarios where there&rsquo;s message loss (<code>at-most-once</code>) or message duplicates (<code>at-least-once</code>) you will be responsible for writing such behaviour by injecting duplicates or skipping messages.</p>
<p>The Lagom in-memory broker implementation will also help testing your message serialisation and deserialisation. That is only available in the tools to <a href="MessageBrokerTesting.html#testing-publishing">test publishing</a> though since the publishing end is the one responsible to describe the messages being sent over the wire. When you test the consuming end of a topic, no de/serialisation will be run under the covers.</p>
<p>The following code samples use the <code>HelloService</code> and <code>AnotherService</code> already presented in previous sections. <code>HelloService</code> publishes <code>GreetingsMessage</code>s on the <code>&quot;greetings&quot;</code> topic and <code>AnotherService</code> subscribed to those messages using <code>atLeastOnce</code> semantics.</p><h2 id="Testing-publish"><a class="section-marker" href="#Testing-publish">§</a><a href="#testing-publish" name="testing-publish">Testing publish</a></h2>
<p>When a Service publishes data into a <code>Topic</code> the descriptor lists a <code>TopicCall</code> on the public API. Testing the event publishing is very similar to testing <code>ServiceCall</code>&rsquo;s in your Service API (see <a href="Test.html#How-to-test-one-service">Service testing</a>). </p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">@Test
public void shouldEmitGreetingsMessageWhenHelloEntityEmitsEnEvent() {
    withServer(setup, server -&gt; {
        PublishService client = server.client(PublishService.class);
        Source&lt;PublishEvent, ?&gt; source = 
              client.messageTopic().subscribe().atMostOnceSource();

        // use akka stream testkit

              source.runWith(
                    TestSink.probe(server.system()), server.materializer()
              );

        PublishEvent actual = probe.request(1).expectNext();
        assertEquals(new PublishEvent(23), actual);

<p>Using a <a href="api/com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/testkit/ServiceTest.html"><code>ServiceTest</code></a> you create a client to your Service. Using that client you can <code>subscribe</code> to the published topics. Finally, after interacting with the Service to cause the emission of some events you can assert events were published on the <code>Topic</code>.</p>
<p>The producer end is responsible to describe the public API and provide the serialisable mappings for all messages exchanged (both in <code>ServiceCall</code>s and <code>TopicCall</code>s). The tests granting the proper behavior of the publishing operations should also test the serialisbility and deserilisability of the messages.</p><h2 id="Testing-subscription"><a class="section-marker" href="#Testing-subscription">§</a><a href="#testing-subscription" name="testing-subscription">Testing subscription</a></h2>
<p>Testing the consumption of messages requires starting the Service under test with a stub of the upstream Service producing data into the topic. The following snippet demonstrates how to achieve it. </p>
<ol>
  <li>A ServiceTest instance is started with a modified <code>Setup</code> where the upstream <code>HelloService</code> is replaced with a <code>HelloServiceStub</code>.</li>
  <li>An instance of a <code>ProducerStub</code> is declared. This instance will be bound when the Server is started and the <code>HelloServiceStub</code> created.</li>
  <li>The Stub for the upstream Service must request a <code>ProducerStubFactory</code> from the Injector and use that to obtain a <code>ProducerStub</code> for the appropriate <code>Topic</code>. See how this snippet uses <code>GREETINGS_TOPIC</code> constant declared in the super interface <code>HelloService</code>. On the stubbed method that implements the <code>TopicCall</code> the stub must return the <code>Topic</code> bound to the <code>ProducerStub</code> created in the constructor.</li>
  <li>Use the <code>ProducerStub</code> on the tests to send messages into the topic and interact normally with the service under test to verify the Service code.</li>
</ol>
