<h1 id="Service-Metadata"><a class="section-marker" href="#Service-Metadata">§</a>Service Metadata</h1>
<p>Service metadata, also referred to as <code>ServiceInfo</code>, includes a name and a collection of Service ACLs. Metadata is computed automatically in most scenarios and you won&rsquo;t need to review it or even provide it.</p>
<p>There are several scenarios supported by Lagom:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When you create a Lagom Service and you use the <a href="ServiceImplementation.html">bindServices</a> method to register services Lagom will consider the first argument in <code>bindServices</code> to be the <code>primaryService</code>. The name of the primary Service will be used as the <code>ServiceInfo</code> name. Then Lagom will gather all the ACLs from all the Services you bind using <code>bindServices</code>. Finally, Lagom will bundle the <code>name</code> and the ACLs into a <code>ServiceInfo</code>.</li>
  <li>When you create a Lagom Service but you don&rsquo;t bind any service. In this situation you can use the <a href="ServiceClients.html#Binding-a-service-client">bindServiceInfo</a> method and provide the metadata manually.</li>
  <li>When you consume Lagom Services from an app that already uses Guice, you simply <a href="ServiceClients.html#Binding-a-service-client">bind a Service Client</a>. In this scenario Lagom is not bundling a ServiceInfo under the covers and you will have to provide one programatically.</li>
  <li>The final scenario is that where the client app is not using Guice and connect to Lagom via the <a href="IntegratingNonLagom.html">Lagom Client Factory</a>. In this scenario, Lagom will also create the metadata on your behalf.</li>
</ol><h2 id="Service-Name-and-Service-ACLs"><a class="section-marker" href="#Service-Name-and-Service-ACLs">§</a>Service Name and Service ACLs</h2>
<p>Services interact with each other. This interaction requires each service to identify itself when acting as a client to another service. When this identity is required, the <code>ServiceInfo</code>&rsquo;s name is used by default. Take for example <code>HelloService</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">import com.lightbend.lagom.javadsl.api.*;

import static com.lightbend.lagom.javadsl.api.Service.*;

public interface HelloService extends Service {
    ServiceCall&lt;String, String&gt; sayHello();

    default Descriptor descriptor() {
        return named(&quot;hello&quot;).withCalls(
                call(this::sayHello)
        );
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If Greetings Service packaged <code>HelloService</code> and Greetings Service was invoking I18n Service (not in the snippet) those calls would include the identity <code>hello</code> since that is the <code>HelloService</code> name (see <code>named(&quot;hello&quot;)</code>).</p>
<p>Services may publish ACLs in a Service Gateway to list what endpoints are provided by the service. These ACLs will allow you to develop <a href="ServiceDiscovery.html#Server-Side-Service-Discovery">Server-Side Service Discovery</a> via a Service Gateway.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">default Descriptor descriptor() {
    return named(&quot;users&quot;)
            .withCalls(
                    restCall(Method.POST, &quot;/api/users/login&quot;, this::login)
            )
            .withAutoAcl(true);</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the developer of <code>UsersService</code> set <code>withAutoAcl</code> to <code>true</code>. That is instructing Lagom to generate Service ACLs from each call&rsquo;s <code>pathPattern</code>. In this example, an ACL for <code>/api/users/login</code> will be created. When deploying, your tools should honour these specifications and make sure your API Gateway is properly setup.</p>
